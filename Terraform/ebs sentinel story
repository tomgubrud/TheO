Summary
Implement a Sentinel policy to ensure all EBS volumes include the correct DLM Backup Tag configuration.
Context
To maintain compliance and operational consistency, all EBS volumes must carry the required DLM Backup tag. Missing or incorrect tagging could result in unmanaged snapshots or policy enforcement failures.
Acceptance Criteria
Sentinel policy must validate that EBS volumes include the ZoneGroupID tag.
The ZoneGroupID tag must have a valid value according to approved mappings (e.g., crit, InfraZone:CZ).
Volumes without the required tag or with invalid tag values must be flagged as noncompliant.
Policy should produce a clear, actionable error message when violations occur.
